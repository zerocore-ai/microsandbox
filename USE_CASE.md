### Coding & Dev Environments

Let your AI agents build real apps with professional dev tools. When users ask their AI to create a web app, fix a bug, or build a prototype, it can handle everything from Git operations to dependency management to testing in a protected environment.

Your AI can create comprehensive development environments in milliseconds and run programs with full system access. The fast startup means developers get instant feedback and can iterate quickly. This makes it perfect for AI pair programming, coding education platforms, and automated code generation where quick results matter.

### Web Browsing Agent

Build AI assistants that can browse the web for your users. Need to compare prices across stores, gather info from multiple news sites, or automate form submissions? Your AI can handle it all while staying in a contained environment.

With microsandbox, your AI can navigate websites, extract data, fill out forms, and handle logins. It can visit any site and deliver only the useful information back to your application. This makes it ideal for price comparison tools, research assistants, content aggregators, automated testing, and web automation workflows that would otherwise require complex setup.

### Instant App Hosting

Share working apps and demos in seconds without deployment headaches. When your AI creates a useful tool, calculator, visualization, or prototype, users can immediately access it through a simple link.

Zero-setup deployment means your AI-generated code can be immediately useful without complex configuration. Each app runs in its own protected space with appropriate resource limits, and everything cleans up automatically when no longer needed. Perfect for educational platforms hosting student projects, AI assistants creating live demos, and users needing immediate value.
