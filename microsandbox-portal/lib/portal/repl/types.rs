//! Types and interfaces for the code evaluation engines.
//!
//! This module provides the fundamental types, traits, and error definitions used by
//! the microsandbox-portal code evaluation system. It defines the language-agnostic
//! interfaces that each specific language implementation must conform to.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The code evaluation system is built around a few key abstractions:
//!
//! - `Language`: An enum representing the supported programming languages
//! - `EngineHandle`: A handle for interacting with the language engines
//! - `Engine`: A trait defining the interface each language engine must implement
//! - `Resp` and `Line`: Types for representing evaluation output
//!
//! Each specific language implementation (Python, Node.js, Rust) provides its own
//! engine that implements the `Engine` trait, but users interact with the system
//! through the `EngineHandle` which provides a unified interface.
//!
//! # Error Handling
//!
//! The module defines an `EngineError` type that encapsulates the various error
//! conditions that can occur during engine initialization, code evaluation, etc.
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! The design accounts for concurrent use by leveraging thread-safe primitives and
//! message passing through channels to communicate between components.
