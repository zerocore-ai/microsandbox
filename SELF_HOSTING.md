To get started, you need to host your own sandbox server. Whether that's on a local machine or in the cloud, it's up to you.

Self hosting lets you manage your own data and code making it easier to comply with security policies. Also, having a sandbox server set up locally allows you to test and move through ideas quickly.

Let's help you start your first self-hosted sandbox server. It's easy!

##

#### 1. Install CLI

```sh
curl -sSL https://get.microsandbox.dev | sh
```

This will install the `msb` CLI tool, which helps you manage sandboxes locally.

##

#### 2. Start Sandbox Server

```sh
msb server start
```

> [!TIP]
>
> Use the `--detach` flag to run the server in the background.
>
> Use the `--dev` flag to skip requiring an API key.
>
> `msb server start --help` for more options.
>
> ##
>
> **microsandbox server** is also an **MCP server**. See [MCP.md](./MCP.md) for more information.

##

#### 3. Pull SDK Images

```sh
msb pull microsandbox/python
```

```sh
msb pull microsandbox/node
```

This pulls and caches the images for the SDKs to use. It is what allows you to run a `PythonSandbox` or `NodeSandbox`.

##

#### 4. Generate API Key

If you are started the server in **dev** mode, you can skip the API key.

```sh
msb server keygen --expire 3mo
```

After generating your key, set the `MSB_API_KEY` environment variable to the generated key.
